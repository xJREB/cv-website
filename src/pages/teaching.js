                        <p>
                            I have taught several lectures, tutorials, or
                            seminars in the general area of software
                            engineering, both at the B.Sc. and M.Sc. level and
                            both in German and English. For two lectures (PE II
                            and SE4AI), I created the lecture content from
                            scratch. Furthermore, I have supervised over 60
                            student projects, mostly B.Sc. and M.Sc. theses. For
                            the teaching certification for higher education from
                            the German state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, I attended
                            several didactic seminars, completed the first
                            module, and integrated concepts like constructive
                            alignment or Bloom's taxonomy of learning objectives
                            into my teaching. My didactic competencies have been
                            further extended and validated when I obtained the
                            University Teaching Qualification (UTQ / BKO) of the
                            Netherlands in April 2024.

                        Justus Bogner holds a B.Sc. in Applied Computer Science
                        from Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University
                        Stuttgart, Germany, and a M.Sc. in Services Computing
                        from University of Applied Sciences Reutlingen, Germany.
                        He was a PhD student in the cooperative doctoral program
                        "Services Computing", a joint initiative between the
                        University of Stuttgart and the University of Applied
                        Sciences Reutlingen. The program was scholarship-funded
                        by the Ministry of Science, Research, and Arts of the
                        state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. He did his PhD under the

                        and later at DXC Technology for more than nine years. He
                        is currently a postdoctoral research scientist in Prof.
                        Wagner's Empirical Software Engineering Group, where he
                        leads the division "Software Engineering for AI- and
                        Microservice-Based Systems" (SE4AI&MS). His main
                        research areas are empirical software engineering,
                        software quality (especially evolvability and technical
                        debt), software architecture, service- and
